# Chapter 1

## Day 1

### Def. **A Set** is a collection of elements with the following properties

Ex. P = {1, 2, *, CWRU, Xander}

1. There are no repeated elements

- Ex.
  - A = {1,2,3},
  - B = {1,~1~,2,~2~,~2~,3}
  - A = B = {1,2,3}

1. Order is irrelevant

- Ex.
  - A = {1,2,3}
  - B = {2,3,1}
  - A = B

### Predefined Sets

(Imagine these letters are fancy looking)

- $Z$: the set of all integers
- $R$: The set of all real numbers
- $Q$: The set of all rational numbers
- $C$: The set of all complex numbers

Adding a plus or minus as a super script to any of these special sets means "all positive ..." or "all negative ..."

(Imagine superscript)

- Ex.
  - $Z^+$: The set of all positive integers
  - $R^-$: The set of all negative real numbers
  - It doesn't really work for $C$

### Def. A is a subset of B  if every element in A is also an element of A

> You Could also say "B contains A" or write "A <= B"

- Ex.
  - $Z$ <= $Q$
