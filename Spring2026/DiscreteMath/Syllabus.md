**CSDS 302 / MATH 304 / EECS 302: Discrete Mathematics**

Shuai Xu - "Professor X"
- Researches Quantum Computing and AI

CS Random Stuff: Quantum Computing
- Cuda is a language for GPU
- Cuda-q is a language for the QPU
- NVQlink links CPU, GPU, QPU

Cleveland Clinic has a quantum computer?

He is one of the professors that teaches the quantum computing class at Case

CS Random Stuff: AI
- X is working on reducing the number of parameters on large models
- Removing redundant parameters

Research opportunities:
- 2-4 positions open
- Send him an email about your interest and cv
- Tell him about a python project in a paragraph
- Pick either quantum computing or ai and tell him which one you'd like to work on
- Very large workload, probably not great with tennis

Syllabus:
- Lectures Recorded
- Attendance not required
- However, sometimes extra credit in class

Components of Class:
1. Homework - 10%
  - Pretty much every week
  - There is a late penalty
  - Penalty is waived with valid excuse
2. Exams - 90%
  - 3 midterms
  - Each midterm is 30%
  - No final exam
  - The exams are not comprehensive, content of exam 2 doesn't include exam 1 content

We will follow the textbook mostly, chapters 1-10, excluding 8
We will also do some extra topics after exams

Introduction:

The "Discrete" in Discrete Mathematics means that you don't work with a continuous line of real numbers
You will work with whole numbers or integers

If you pick a random real number. The chance that it will be rational is 0

Mathematics is just a language, it communicates between sciences. You learn math in the same way that you learn a language

Teaching Style:
- "Def." means that it is a definition
- "Ex." Is an example problem
