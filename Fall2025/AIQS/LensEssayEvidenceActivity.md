Note: "The Book" in 1984 is very helpful

## Euchronia
### Viera discusses how Utopia
- "it no longer made sense, at a time when the utopist believed that his ideals could rendered concrete with the help of time, to place the imaginary society on
a remote island or in an unknown, inaccessible place.
- "The birth of euchronia was due to a change of mentality,
presided over by the optimistic worldview that prevailed in Europe in the
Enlightenment. In the Renaissance, man discovered that there were alterna-
tive options to the society he lived in"
### 1984 takes place in the future
- 1984 takes place in 1984 in what used to be London

## Anti-Utopia
### Viera:
- "When the idea of euchronia came to be systematically promoted (i.e.,
when utopian thought turned towards the future), it was inevitably accom-
panied by the imagination of darker times. The idea of 'utopia gone wrong'
was not naturally born then, though: from time immemorial people have
thought about the possibility of the construction of a better world, but they
have also been aware of the likelihood of a future which might be worse
than the present."
### 1984 raises questions about whether the past was better than the present:
- "The world today is a bare, hungry, dilapidated place when compared with the world before 1914" (188)
- Rations consistently are dropping, production rates are dropping: "Winston was aware, the chocolate ration wa
s to be reduced from thirty grammes to twenty at the end of the present week.
- "Winston, however, in rewriting the forecast, marked the figure down to fifty-seven millions, so as to allow
for the usual claim that the quota had been overfulfilled. In any case, sixty-two millions was no nearer the tr
uth than fifty-seven millions, or than one-hundred-and-forty-five millions. Very likely no boots had been produ
ced at all. Likelier still, nobody knew how many had been produced, much less cared. All one knew was that ever
y quarter astronomical numbers of boots were produced on paper"

## Technology and Dytopia
### Viera page 5 on the left
- Technology was originally used to advance society and that's why utopias were more popular in earlier times
- There was a flip to dystopia after WWs because technology was used to kill people
### Orwell
- Atomic Bomb 
- Telesreens pg. 3
- Two minutes hate
- Goldstein Book highlights how technology is just used for evil

## Real-World Euchronian Socialists
### Viera
- Argues that some people like Hitler and Marx(?) wanted to create a utopian society
### Orwell
- Agrees but

## The purpose of Utopia is to inspire the readers to make changes in their world and give them hope if they aren't happy

## Utopia must be realistic but not reality.
### Viera
- It can't be Science fiction because then it won't have any effect on people
- But it can't be reality because then it won't inspire change
- (It was right before the Euchronia section)
### Orwell
- Orwell perfectly threads the needle by having his novel take place in 1984


# Stuff that Dr. Hoeynck Says

## 1. Dystopias & Hope & Civic Responsibility
- pg. 8 of Viera "Dystopiasthat leave no room for hope..."

## 2. Past and Present: GOOD CONCEPT
- pg. 4 of Viera discusses how they reject the past "One of the main features of utopia as a literary genre is
its relationship
with reality. Utopists depart from the observation of the society they live
in, note down the aspects that need to be changed and imagine a place
where those problems have been solved", pg 5. "Such utopias reject
their past (faced as anti-utopian), offer a frozen image of the present, and
eliminate the idea of a future from their horizon: there is no progress after
the ideal society has been established."
- Orwell pg. 155: Winston discusses how the past has been abolished. Julia believes that this is a positive and
 utopian, Winston disagrees and believes it to be negative
